A correct and consistent registration between synthetic augmentations and the real environment is one of the most important tasks for augmented reality. Thus the tracing and registration problem is one of the most fundamental challenges in AR research problem today.

Besides tracking, display technology is another basic building block for augmented reality.

The third basic element for augmented reality is real-time rendering. Since AR mainly concentrates on superimposing the real environment with graphical elements, fast and realistic rendering methods play an important role.

Here is the Book: Spatial Augmented Reality.

Today is 28 of September in 2013, and it's Saturday. After two days there will be a seven days vacation, but today is just like the vacation was begining. I feel so tired, and cannot dive into learning, but I still stick to the study. Of course the efficiency is very low, and I feel tired.

####Why?
Why I feel so tired and can not calm down to learn?

- The comming vacation is of course one of the reasons. Even I just see the vacation like everyday, but it still has some impact on my mind.

- What I am doing is hard. Those days I was doing a hard job, today and yesterday I was doing the job, and had little progress.

####Doing
I was doing the project in school, it makes some achievements, but the problem I encountered before still not solved. Except the project I had to do, I also did a more interesting project, the project was completed with open source resource. It's familiar with the project I need to do in school.

####Plan
- Completed my project at the end of the mouth, it's almost done.
- Do something to apply for a job, like write a CV.
- Spend more time on preparing the new school.
- Write a thesis for my project.
- Improve the project I need to do.
- Start a new project.

####Thinking
When considering to find a job, you will think of what you have done in school. Take myself for instance, I can think of little project I had completed. Well everyday I was busy for something, and had learn many things, even I had done something with the things I learn, but I had not summarized the things I had done before. And with the thing I learn I somethime just did some examples, it can not be called project. So, everytime you should know what you want to do, the you learn something.

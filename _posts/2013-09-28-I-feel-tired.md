####Why?
Why I feel so tired and can not calm down to learn?

- The comming vacation is of course one of the reasons. Even I just see the vacation like everyday, but it still has some impact on my mind.

- What I am doing is hard. Those days I was doing a hard job, today and yesterday I was doing the job, and had little progress.

- I had little rest these days. It's about 9 clock when I come up today. And I make me so busy those days, just work all the time.

- Well learning I was just doing the other things, like watching a video. Multitasking make me feel more tired than just working. 

- I had not thinking what I am doing, to complete the job, I was trying and trying, but not think what I am doing. I was lost. 

####Should Do
Analyzing the reason what make me tired, what should I do?

- I should have a break, not sit down before the PC, I should leave the office, and clam me down.

- I should doing some work more easy and interesting. I can also just reaing some books instad of sit before the PC.

- I should also change position, I can go to the library and classrome.

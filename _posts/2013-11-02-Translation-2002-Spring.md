The sheep cloned from the cells of adult sheep not only open up the possibility of a broad science, but also brought a moral dilemma. 

The photos of a common exterior lamb named Dolly became the front pages of newspapers and magazines around the world last week. It's because her born was amazing.  She was a replica of an adult lamb, and no father.

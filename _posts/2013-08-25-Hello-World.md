###Sparkling Lines

- Everything is going on, but dont give up trying.
- No one can defeat us unless we first defeat ourselves.
- Go as far as you can see; when you get there you'll be able to see farther.
- To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
- If you care about what others think of you, then you will always be their slave.
- Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.

Some people travelled on the luxury cruise shipï¼Œif Xei Lingyun was reincarnated, he might did so. Some people carried bags, tramp over hill and dale. Someone travel around the world riding a bicycle. All of these make me envy. What I think is driving for the long march, and go to the ends of the earth. My wife loves to travel than me, so two people just for the companion, Xu Xiake will envy for this. But Xu Xiake was the big traveler and explorer, we are just travele for fun.

I dont think people dont like to go and have a look aroud: look at more people and travel more countries, which not only can make you understand the world, but also know yourself. Some people travel by lunxury cruise ships, Xie Lingyun, a poet, if he is still alive now, he will probably do like this. Some carry luggage to tramp over mountains and through ravines. And some rides bikes to travle around the world. And all these ways made me jealous. But I prefer to drive to visit the remotest corners of the globe. My wife loves travel more than me, so we two are travelling companion of each other, which may make the traveler Xu Xiake envious. However, Xu Xiake is a great traveller and explorer, and we are just travelling around.

### Opportunity and success

Many people think the one who is success is because he or she has the opportunity. But is that so? 

I dont think so. The one who has the opportunity may also failed. Opportunity is not equal to success, but one of the element to be success. If you want success, you must work hard and consider many other things to be success. Of course, opportunity is also the important element to be success. Sometime everything is OK, but lack the opportunity, he or she can still not be success.

On the other hand, even he or she has the opportunity need to be sucess, but still failed, why? Because, they dont get ready and catch the opportunity. Even sometime there is no opportunity apparent, but you can make your own opportunity, if you are ready to it. So dont wait the opportunity come to you, but prepare and make the opportunity. Once the opportunity appears, catch it, and with the other element, you can be success.

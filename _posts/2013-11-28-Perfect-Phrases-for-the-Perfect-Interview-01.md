###Top Eight Word Mistakes Candidates Make in Job Interview

####1 Use language that is too informal

It is important to remember that you are interviewing for a job, not trying to make a new best friend.

####2 The use of words that are vague

Words such as "a lot," "various/multiple," and "great deal of" are vague and don't give interviewer the needed information.

####3 Misuse of pronouns

It can be very confusing and words can be misinterpreted when pronouns are misused.

####4 Using company-specific words

Each company has certain terms that are indigenous only to that company. Outsiders will not know what you are talking about if you use these terms.

####5 Assuming everyone konws the acronym you are using

Acronyms are used at every company-shortcuts used internally to eliminate a lot of words.Avoid using these in an interview because the hiring manager may not be familiar with the acronyms used at your current company.

####6 Describing skills by using "weak" words

Beware of small words that can sabotage your credibility-words like "pretty","most of the time," and "kind of."

####7 Use too few words to answer the question

One pet peeve many interviewers have is not getting enough information. 

####8 Talking too much-not getting to the point

When you fail to prepare for the interview, you can easily ramble and go off the subject down some other road.

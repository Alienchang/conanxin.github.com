### How to prevent plagiarism in academic world

Serveral plagiarism cases in academic world have been exposed in China in the past few years. Not only the graduate students who are working as researchers, but the professoes and famous scholars are involved. 

Plagiasism in academic world is just like the student cheating in school, it should be completely eradicate. Or it will bring about bad morality, and it can damage the academic advancement. But how to prevent plagiarism in academic world?

In my opinion, it should take the following measures:

- Some reviewed in academic should be loosened. In some school, if a student want to graduate, he or she should be published papers in journals. Will these requirement make some student plagiarize to publish papers.
- It should be reviewed more strict. If the reviewed can be more strict, some plagiasisms may not happen. The piratic academic achievements can not be published.
- The punishment should be more severely. If the punishment of the people who are plagiarized is severely enough, some people may fear to plagiarize.
- The people who are participate in the academic research should get more education in academic intergrity.

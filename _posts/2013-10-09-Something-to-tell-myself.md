It's a long time since the previous post, the long holiday for October Day had past. During the holiday, I had not not studied, and visited serval places in Beijing accompanied with my cousin. But I still thinking about somethig like some of the future, so at first I didnot visited with heart and soul, but in the end I was in the holiday and indulged myself. So at the end of the holiday, I was so tired. But I went back to work quickly. Something I had to do and can not escaped. After the holiday I really found the time past so fast, and I had so much work to do. I should know waht I am doing everytime, and spend the limited time do the right things.

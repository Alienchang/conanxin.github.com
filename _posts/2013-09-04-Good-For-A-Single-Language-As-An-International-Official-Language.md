### Good for a single language as an international official language

There are many different kinds of languages in the world, so it is not convenient for the people spoke in diferent languages to communicate. Then if there is a single language as an international official language, the world would be more efficient and conveniency.

Actually, English is more or less like an general language. If one can speak English well, he or she can have no difficulty to communication in many countires of the world.

Many people worry that it will make difficult toidentity countries and lose culture, if make only one language as an international official language. Well, that harm it is not so serious. Let's take the English-speaking countries as an example, those countries spesking the same language, well their cultures are not the same.

So, compared with the possible harms, it's benefit for everyone in the world if there is an international official language.

Well, I had a long time not update the blog. What I am doing recently?

####Decisions
I give up preparing the school I wanted to before, and I change to preparing for a new school, which is more suit for me. But the new school is unfamiliar for me, and it is far away form me. So what will the result be? 

####Doing
I was doing the project in school, it makes some achievements, but the problem I encountered before still not solved. Except the project I had to do, I also did a more interesting project, the project was completed with open source resource. It's familiar with the project I need to do in school.

####Plan
- Completed my project at the end of the mouth, it's almost done.
- Do something to apply for a job, like write a CV.
- Spend more time on preparing the new school.
- Write a thesis for my project.
- Improve the project I need to do.
- Start a new project.

####Thinking
When considering to find a job, you will think of what you have done in school. Take myself for instance, I can think of little project I had completed. Well everyday I was busy for something, and had learn many things, even I had done something with the things I learn, but I had not summarized the things I had done before. And with the thing I learn I somethime just did some examples, it can not be called project. So, everytime you should know what you want to do, the you learn something.

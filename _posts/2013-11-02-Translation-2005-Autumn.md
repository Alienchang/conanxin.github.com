Women are emploied to engage in primary management in American companies, the number is more than the symbolic number for 10 years. After ten years of trying, how is the  performance of the women in promotion? The answer is they donot as good as their male rivals. Even women have achieved great progress in the early and middle management, but facing difficulties to enter the senior management. Janet Jones-Parker is the Administrative Director in the league of the management personnel recruitment consultancy services. "There is a kind of invisible barriers hindering the further development of women. They met with obstacles after working for 8 to 10 years.", she said.

When the annual salary level up to 75 ~ 100 thousands, the trouble began to appear, and seems the upper, the more trouble. In the top 500 of American industries which are listed in Fortune, only one women in the general managers, she is Katharine Graham in Washington Post Co. She admitted readily, the reason is her family is the controlling shareholder of the company.

Think of these women have been in management for 10 years, none of them had the chance to the top management, especially surprising. When the hiring managers need to find the possible women to be Chief Executive or Managing Director in the Fortune 500. They found no women. Even those companies that have women in senior management,  admit privately that these women are not likely to be top of the head of the company.

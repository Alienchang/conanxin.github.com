###Big vs. Little: Is a Start-up Right for You?

####The Good

- **Diversity of skills.** Whereas big companies have designated marketing and finance people, start-ups never have enough people to fill every role. And the smaller the company, the more hats you have to wear.

- **Leadership opportunities.** Many people join a company and find that within months they're expected to manage several new hires. You'd have to be at a bigger company for years to get such an opportunity.

- **Control and influnence.** Each time a bit of my work shipped at a big company, I was able to point to it and say, "I did that." At a startup, howere, you are not only shapping the company in how you perform your immdiate responsibilities, but you're also offering feedback on all aspects of the business.

- **Rapid results** You won't have to wait years to see your work out in the real world; it'll happen within months.

- **High reward.** Start-up can make you very, very rich if you get very lucky.

####The Bad

- **Long hours.** With the amount of money and careers depending on a start-up's success, long hours are critical.
- **Unclear job description.** You are hired in to be a tester, and now you're helping look for office space.
- **Low pay.** With very few exceptions, start-ups tend to pay below-industry salary and compensate for the difference with stock options.
- **Limited credibility.** You may join a start-up, only to have it fail after a few years. And all of a sudden you're back on the job market with some no-name company on your resume that wasn't good enough to survive.
- **Less mentorship.** Big company have invested time and money in understanding how to train new employees; start-ups lack both of those things.

### What Do You Want to Be When You Grow Up?

####What Do You Need?
- **Money.** Money may not buy happiness, but it does buy your kid's college tuition. And a house in a nice neighborhood. Or maybe just a nice bottle of wine after a hard week. Does that matter to you?
- **Recognition and respect.** How much do you care about what others think of you? Would you be OK with people giving just a courtesy smile when you say your profession?
- **Work/Life balance.** There is nothing wrong with wanting a nice, stable, 9-to-5 job.

####How Do You Enjoy Working?
- **Teamwork vs. independent work.**
- **Creating vs. maintaining.**
- **Leading vs. joining.**

####What Are You Good At?
- **Numbers.** 
- **Writing and communication.**
- **Creativity.**
